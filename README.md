# Travian-Bot
A very old project of mine, while I started playing Travian, seeing that all the bots have started to fall,
I decided to create my own, with limited PHP Knowledge at that time(young coder), I started coding on this
system.

# Why did I add it?
It's quite simple, I've remember sending an email to the travian board telling them that I created a functional
bot that works on a simple webserver, they only discredited me saying that I don't know what i am talking about.

# Informations
The utils folder is called "engine" in my coding template, you can find there the tapi.php file and the dom.php one,
both are needed to create your own working bot(tough might need some updates on them). I hope this will help future
coders at their job.

# Wanna update the project? Read this.
Do you want to help this project expand? It's quite simple, just send a push request and I will check it as soon as
possible, please try to mantain the coding style in which I wrote(or rewrite the entire project, It's entirely up to you!)


P.S: I do not remember if the template I used was free or not, please send me a message if you are the owner of this template
and want it removed.
